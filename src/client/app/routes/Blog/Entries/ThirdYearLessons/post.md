# Three Years Later: Lessons Learned as a Software Engineer
![thinker](https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2016/05/0512_the-thinker05-wide.jpg)
I was recently at LA Tech Fair and some of the people I talked to reached out later asking for advice on breaking into the industry. They reminded me of when I was in their shoes a few years ago at Cal, walking from employer booth to employer booth, wondering if anyone would take a chance on me. I've since then worked on a variety of problems across teams large and small all over LA, and wanted to update the lessons post I wrote after my first job at YP. If you're just starting out in your career, I hope these thoughts help you with some of the ambiguity and imposter syndrome you might be feeling and if you're a decade-of-experience expert thinking this post is about to be full of shit, I'd love to know your thoughts on what mattered most in your career. Here's what I learned.

Communication Trumps Individual Smarts

It's easy after college to look at each problem like another homework assignment to crush, but industry work often doesn't have solutions you can glean from a textbook, the ambiguous nature of what might be causing a 5 second slowdown on your site means work hinges a lot on investigation, context, and communicating iwth others.

Early on I'd make a mistake of quickly coming up with a solution or getting frustrated at some component of the technical architecture I was working with, it's important in these situations to take a step back to understand context before assuming the status quo is the best way to do things.

Berkeley helped with this, in my last year I took the Software Engineering course where you build a product for a semester and it was the closest thing to real work there is.

No One Will Challenge You Except Yourself

You need to stay sharp, the industry moves quickly and thugh you may think you know React now, nothing should be taken for granted--not even those lifecycle methods your hacks rely on ;) Continue learning and investing in yourself, its on you to protect your career.

Pracice TDD, get out of your pond and attend meetups

Recalibrate Often I think we don't do a good job of listening to ourselves, it's easy to get sucked into the blackhole of whatever you are working on, be sure to periodically reflect and ensure that whatever you're working on brings you closer to your long term gaols. And if you don't have long term goals, make them. A ship letting itself sail according to whatever momentary breeze is happening currently will probably end up no further than where it started in 10 years.
